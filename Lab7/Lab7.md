First import the private key `lab7privkey` using the following command:

```bash
gpg --import lab7privkey
```

`Woof`

***

- What is the MD5 hash of file3.txt?

`ddbefc9c1d8a8d9195a420a7181352e9`

***

- What is the SHA1 hash of the MD5 hash of file3.txt? In other words, what is SHA1(MD5(file3.txt))?

`eda05a705bfe77e5d4cbab81c358cdbcc18b8b4a`
