# This a simple phonebook script that does the following:

# ./phonebook new <name> <number> adds an entry to the phonebook. Donâ€™t worry about duplicates (always add a new entry, even if the name is the same).

# ./phonebook list displays every entry in the phonebook (in no particular order). If the phonebook has no entries, display phonebook is empty

# ./phonebook remove <name> deletes all entries associated with that name. Do nothing if that name is not in the phonebook.

# ./phonebook clear deletes the entire phonebook.

# ./phonebook lookup <name> displays all phone number(s) associated with that name.
# You can assume all phone numbers are in the form ddd-ddd-dddd where d is a digit from 0-9.
