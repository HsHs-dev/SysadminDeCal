3. How many distinct hosts can 127.0.0.0/8 contain?

Simple calculation:

- Subtract the netmask (/8) from the number IP address number of bits (e.g. 32): $32 - 8 = 24$

- calculate $2^n$ where n is the number of remainig bits (e.g. 24): $2^{24} = 16,777,216$

Number of distinct hostst 127.0.0.0/8 contains is `16,777,216`
